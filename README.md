To help install titles recently added to that titlekey site, that have a decrypted titlekey but not yet an encrypted one.

Run this app to download decTitleKeys.bin, reboot to Decrypt9 to encrypt it to encTitleKeys.bin, then run this app again to select which title and generate an input.txt - which can be opened with CIAngel to install the chosen title.
